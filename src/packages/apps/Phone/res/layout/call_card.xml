<!-- XML resource file for the CallCard used in the Phone app.

     Note that the CallCard is technically the size of the full screen (since
     our parent container is full-screen, and the layout_width and layout_height
     here are both "match_parent"), but we manually adjust its bottom margin
     in CallCard.updateCallInfoLayout() to make sure it doesn't overlap with
     the onscreen buttons from incall_touch_ui.xml. -->
<com.android.phone.CallCard xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:id="@+id/call_info_container"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"
    android:orientation="vertical">

    <!-- The main content of the CallCard is either one or two "call info"
         blocks, depending on whether one or two lines are in use.

         The call_info blocks are stacked vertically inside a CallCard (LinearLayout),
         each with layout_weight="1".  If only one line is in use (i.e. the
         common case) then the 2nd call info will be GONE and thus the 1st one
         will expand to fill the full height of the CallCard.

         We set a bottom margin on this element dynamically (see
         updateCallInfoLayout()) to make sure it doesn't overlap with either
         the bottom button cluster or the incoming-call widget. -->

    <!-- Primary "Call info" block, for the foreground call. -->
    <include android:id="@+id/primary_call_info"
         layout="@layout/primary_call_info" />

    <!-- Secondary "Call info" block , for the background ("on hold") call. -->
    <ViewStub android:id="@+id/secondary_call_info"
         android:layout="@layout/secondary_call_info"
         android:layout_width="match_parent"
         android:layout_height="0dp"
         android:layout_weight="1" />

</com.android.phone.CallCard>
